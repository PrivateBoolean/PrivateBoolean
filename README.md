- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @PrivateBoolean
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in programming, video games, all things computer. I also enjoy knitting and crocheting, so there. My dark secret is out now.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning things like PHP and web development. I try to take a peek into different technologies to gain a better understanding of what's going on 
and what possibilities are out there.
I don't yet have "my own language", though Java so far seems to be my favourite. I also enjoy SQL and all that good stuff!

It seems like I don't have many commits in here. I think I have a habit of hiding my things in a dark folder somewhere on my computer, hidden from the world. I guess 
I should showcase things more.
